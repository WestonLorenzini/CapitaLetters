Just got into minecraft modding, not much experience in java in general aswell. Trying my best and appreciating criticism.
This is the first mod I have created so far.

CapitaLetters Alpha ver1.0 (for Minecraft 1.12)

What this mod does so far:

- adding capital letters (whole alphabet) to the game
- rotated models, boundings and hitboxes depending on the direction player is facing
- NOTE: blocks are only achievable in CREATIVE MODE due to not yet implemented crafting recipes!

What is planned for future versions:

- more characters (digits, symbols such as "period", "question mark", etc.)
- crafting recipes
- different colors and color changing (dying)

Programs used:

Eclipse Java Oxygen
