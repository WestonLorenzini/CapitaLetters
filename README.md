# CapitaLetters
Just got into minecraft modding, not much experience in java in general aswell. Trying my best and appreciating criticism.
I personally have always been looking for a mod that implements "big letters" to Minecraft for labeling a shop or things like that.
Now I have decided to write one myself and this is the first outcome.

CapitaLetters Alpha ver1.0 (for Minecraft 1.12)

What this mod does so far:

- adding capital letters (whole alphabet) to the game
- rotated models, boundings and hitboxes depending on the direction player is facing
- NOTE: blocks are only achievable in CREATIVE MODE due to not yet implemented crafting recipes!

What is planned for future versions:

- more characters (digits, symbols such as "period", "question mark", etc.)
- crafting recipes
- different colors and color changing (dying)

*"src.zip" contains all relevant packages and classes you need to continue coding on your own or just looking at the source code. If you just want to test out the mod, download and install "capitaLetters 1.12.jar" (Forge for MCVersion 1.12 required).*
